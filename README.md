# Dynamic Product Grid

This project implements a responsive product grid that dynamically loads more content as the user scrolls or clicks a "Scroll More" button. It's designed to provide an efficient and user-friendly way to display a large number of products.

## Features

* **Responsive Layout:** Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, displaying 4 product cards per row on desktops and 2 cards per row on mobile devices.
* **Dynamic Loading:** Initially loads a set of product cards, and then dynamically loads 12 new cards when the "Scroll More" button is clicked. This enhances performance by reducing the initial load time.
* **"Scroll More" Button:** A fixed button at the bottom of the screen allows users to easily load more products.
* **Clean and Organized Structure:** Utilizes HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the dynamic loading functionality.

## Technologies Used
